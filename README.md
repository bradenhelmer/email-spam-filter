CSC 424 Class Project

## Dummy Email
We created a fake email to sign up for spam and use for the filter.<br>

We used the [SalemWebNetwork](https://preferences.salemwebnetwork.com/) to generate a bunch of spam email.

## Python Setup
Using Pipenv for dependency management, when cloning repo: <br>
1. Run ```pipenv install --dev``` to setup virtual environment.
2. Run ```pipenv shell``` to spawn shell in venv.<br>
When editing the ```Pipfile```, make sure to run the command in step 1 again to regenerate ```Pipfile.lock``` to be committed.
